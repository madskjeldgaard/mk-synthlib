# Plundered from all around
This is my SuperCollider synthdef library and factory. It produces tons of variations of synths that I use. 

### Usage
This library is meant for myself and I am not offering support in using it, but feel free to try it anyway and steal bits of it for your own projects.

### Settings

```
s.options.maxSynthDefs_(10000);
```
